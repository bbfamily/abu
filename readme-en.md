#### Abu seeks the intelligent-strategy which be able to explained by of a word.

Abu can help users to improve the strategy automatically, take the initiative to analyze the behavior of the orders generated by the strategy to prevent the losing-money transaction.

Right now, we still writting code by hand, abu is designed to be running complete-automatically in the future, including the entire work-process and strategy itself.

Our expectations : abu users only need to provide some seed strategy, on the basis of these seeds, computer continue to self-learning, self-growth, to build a new strategy which can adjust its parameters  with the time series data.
